				My first colorwork pattern! I saw a knitted bow tie in this adorable little shop and thought, “I NEED to make this!” so I tinkered around with the shape and size, how to create the scrunched look in the middle and how to attach the collar to the bow. Eventually I got the basic pattern down and decided to add some blue and dark grey chevron stripes for a bit more flair. This bow tie fits perfectly with my boyfriend’s wardrobe and he has gotten so many compliments from friends and strangers! It was such a quick knit, I could have made fifteen of them, and I definitely considered it. I’m excited to do more colorworking in the future; it adds so much to a pattern and, once you get the hang of juggling multiple balls of yarn, it’s really quite simple! I can think of so many beautiful color combinations, the possibilities are endless! This pattern is now officially in the shop, along with everything you need to make one (or five) of these yourself!
