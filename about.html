				<h2>Hello! I am Colleen Higgins and I love knitting.</h2>
				<h5>When did you start knitting? </h5>
				<p>
					I learned how to knit when I was 8 or 9 years old, though I didn't
					get very good until high school. My mom taught me the knit stitch
					and then I just ran with it, finding free patterns and then learning
					whatever skills I needed in order to complete it. Eventually I started
					changing patterns around and building my own.
				</p>
				<h5>Why is knitting special to you? </h5>
				<p>
					The idea of knitting is so powerful. You start with a fairly useless 
					and (honestly) boring pile of yarn and with some creativity and work 
					you can end up with a beautiful and functional piece of art. Knitting
					has become a part of my identity; when a friend or stranger compliments 
					my scarf or asks where I bought my hat, I get a rush of pride and a 
					sense of accomplishment.I keep my knitting with me at pretty much all
					times. When I'm watching, I always pull out my knitting. If I'm waiting 
					for the subway, I try to get a few rows in. My phone is filled with 
					pictures of instructions and notes on patterns I'm working on.
				</p>
				<h5>How would you describe the designs you make?</h5>
				<p>
					My goal is to make functional, wearable art that is fun to knit and 
					comfortable to wear. I write my patterns so that they are easily 
					understandable and I try to provide as many resources as possible so 
					that the knitting process can be relaxing and enjoyable. 
				</p>
